Project Title : Developing STL for Trees 

    Idea of the project is to develop a STL library for Trees
    -type of trees covered : Binary Trees, BST.
    -data type inserted into the tree is made generic 
    -container to be used is made user defined 
    -define iterators to make it work with existing algorithms 
    -arrange the elements in the tree based on a binary predicate that is specified by the       	user when he wishes, else a default predicate for ???? will be used
    -container used is also specified by the user provided it has the required functions.
    -a few of the functions covered would be 
        depth of the tree, 
        number of leaves, 
        number 	of nodes, 
        traversals, 
        inserting and deleting elements, 
        exists, 
        find, 
        listchildren, etc

    Initial scope of the project : 
        develop code for - Binary Trees,
        where data type is generic,
	with user defined predicates,
        and implement it for the containers : vector , list, deque
